       * Typical usage:
       * var tdna = new TypingDNA(); // creates a new TypingDNA object and starts recording
       * var typingPattern = tdna.getTypingPattern({type=1, text="Hello5g21?*"});
       * returns a type 1 typing pattern (and continues recording afterwards)
       *
       * Optional:
       * tdna.stop(); // ends recording and clears history stack (returns recording flag: false)
       * tdna.start(); // restarts the recording after a stop (returns recording flag: true)
       * tdna.reset(); // restarts the recording anytime, clears history stack and starts from scratch (returns nothing)
       * var typingPatternQuality = TypingDNA.getQuality(typingPattern); //returns the quality/strength of any typing pattern
       * (there is no need to initialize the class to do pattern quality checking)
